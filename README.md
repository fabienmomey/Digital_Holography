# Web_Interface_Hologram_Reconstruction_by_Regularized_Inversion
## UPDATES
### V0.1 -- 28/04/20
Basic version left by the previous developer.
The web interface has an Index that summarizes a small part of the subject and allows to choose between two types of algorithms.
The Page of the first algorithm is functional and allows to use four presets or to upload a picture by ourselves and to enter the parameters of the algorithm.
The interface also allows to visualize the resulting image which is a little bit small with different depths possible.
### V0.2 -- 02/05/20
Added a CSS layer to the Index to make it more pleasing to the eye.
Added a vertical menu on the left to make navigation between the different pages easier.
### V0.3 -- 08/05/20
Added a CSS layer to the other pages of the interface with a menu on the left to facilitate navigation between the different pages.
### V1.0 -- 12/05/20
Modification of the result page of the algorithm.
Changing the dimensions of the result image to see it better.
Adding a script to zoom in real time on the result image and display the zoom next to it.
### V2.0 -- 28/05/20
Addition of Yohann's reconstruction algorithm using the Fienup method.
You must unzip the opencv_world430 archive to the folder where it is located. The file is too big for GitHub, so I had to compress it.
### V2.1 -- 31/05/20
Addition of a database that allows us to check if we have already done a reconstruction with the parameters that have been entered, if this is the case, then we open the result directly and do not run the algorithm again.
